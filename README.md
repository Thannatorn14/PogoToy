this small txt document will demonstrate to you how the project is to be run on your computer

1. to start using poggoToy, first you open up ide of your choic andmust put the current directory to the main frontend server path (the folder where PoggoToyClient is located).
from there type "npm start" into the terminal and you should see "Server listening on port: 8025" as a responds

2. Next connect the SQL with our .env file. Firstly open up MySQL and login, run the .sql file once to generate the schema and set user and privileges to allow access to the data base(located in the server option at the top left). Set the user name to be "team25" and host as "localhost", the password should be set as "UK44RE", click apply and move to the schema Privileges. From here click add entry an add toy_catalog into it. Afterward, select the toy_catalog schema and tick "SELECT","INSERT","UPDATE", and "DELETE" in Object Right section
click apply and that's all for the sql.

3.lastly,go back to your ide and set the current path to the server folder(the one with the PoggoToyService.js inside). Type "npm start" into the terminal and you should see "Server listening on port: 8125" and "Connected DB: toy_catalog" as a responds, if an error occure check that you did step 2 correctly or contact us for help.
